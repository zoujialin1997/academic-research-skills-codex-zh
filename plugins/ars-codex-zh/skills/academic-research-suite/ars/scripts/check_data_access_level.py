"""Lint: every top-level SKILL.md declares the PINNED data_access_level.

Single pass per skill, one violation per problem: frontmatter must parse,
the skill must be registered in EXPECTED_LEVELS, and the declared value
must equal its pin. The governing rule (`ground_truth_isolation_pattern.md`
§ "Declare `data_access_level` truthfully") requires the annotation to
reflect the DIRTIEST input the skill may legitimately consume across all
its modes.

Pin provenance (honest-claim discipline) — all four pins are now
derivation-backed under the dirtiest-input rule:

- `academic-pipeline: raw` — #756-derived (Stage 1 accepts raw user
  requests, mid-entry accepts raw papers; the gates run inside the
  pipeline).
- `academic-paper: raw` — #773-derived. Standalone modes (revision,
  revision-coach, rebuttal-audit, citation-check, ...) ingest ungated
  user drafts and third-party reviewer comments, and
  literature_strategist_agent's search-fills-gap flow ingests
  external-index search results inside the skill — Layer-1 inputs both.
  The prior `redacted` described the orchestrated pipeline path, where
  Stage 2 inputs arrive as Stage-1 sanitized artifacts (Gate 2.5 runs
  AFTER Stage 2, so "post-gate" would overstate even that path).
- `academic-paper-reviewer: raw` — #773-derived. The standalone
  `/ars-reviewer` entry (Routing Discipline Step 1 routes "review my
  paper" directly) legitimately consumes an ungated pasted manuscript;
  `verified_only` was at best true for the pipeline's initial Stage 3
  dispatch (post-Gate-2.5) — Stage 3' re-review consumes a freshly
  revised manuscript before Stage 4.5 — and the rule quantifies over
  ALL entry paths.
- `deep-research: raw` — #773 re-affirmed on its inputs: raw user
  queries and unverified web/database search results are its core
  intake. A ceiling argument additionally applies (`raw` is the
  dirtiest value, so no re-derivation could move it further).

Changing any pin must be a deliberate, reviewed re-application of the rule,
and a new top-level skill must be registered here before it passes.
